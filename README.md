# Random-password-generator
A random password generator is a tool  that creates strong passwords automatically using random combinations of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. It is used to replace weak, easy‑to‑guess passwords with long, complex ones that are much harder for hackers to crack.​
